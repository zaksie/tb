<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p><em>Last Updated: March 28, 2025</em></p>

<p>This Privacy Policy explains how Battle Squire ("we," "us," or "our") collects, uses, and protects your information when you use our application ("App"). We are committed to safeguarding your privacy and ensuring that your personal information is handled responsibly.</p>

<h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
<p>We do not collect or store personally identifiable information (PII) unless it is strictly necessary to provide you access to the App or to deliver our services. To enable your use of Battle Squire and provide features such as crypting or chest counting, we may collect:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Minimal account details, such as an email address or username, to authenticate your access to the App.</li>
  <li>Credentials you provide to us, which we use solely to access your account on your behalf to perform requested services (e.g., crypting or chest counting).</li>
</ul>
<p>We do not collect any additional personal data beyond what is essential for these purposes.</p>

<h2>2. How We Use Your Information</h2>
<p>Any PII or credentials we collect are used exclusively to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Authenticate and provide you access to Battle Squire.</li>
  <li>Perform services you request, such as crypting or chest counting, by accessing your account on your behalf with the credentials you provide.</li>
</ul>
<p>We do not use your information for any other purpose, such as marketing, analytics, or profiling.</p>

<h2>3. Data Sharing</h2>
<p>We do not share, sell, or disclose your information—including any credentials or account data—to any third parties under any circumstances, except as required by law (e.g., to comply with a legal obligation or protect our rights).</p>

<h2>4. Data Security</h2>
<p>When we collect PII or credentials necessary for access or services, they are encrypted using industry-standard security measures to protect them from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. While we strive to keep your information secure, no method of transmission or storage is completely infallible. We are committed to maintaining robust safeguards to protect your data.</p>

<h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
<p>We only retain your PII and credentials for as long as necessary to provide you access to Battle Squire and perform the requested services. Once they are no longer needed, we securely delete them. We do not store your credentials beyond the duration required to complete the specific service you requested.</p>

<h2>6. Your Rights</h2>
<p>You may request access to, correction of, or deletion of any PII we hold about you by contacting us at <a href="mailto:support@battle-squire.com">support@battle-squire.com</a>. We will respond promptly to your request. Note that credentials you provide are only used temporarily and are not retained beyond the service duration.</p>

<h2>7. Changes to This Policy</h2>
<p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted within the App, and the "Last Updated" date will reflect the latest revision. We encourage you to review this policy periodically.</p>

<h2>8. Contact Us</h2>
<p>If you have questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy or our practices, please contact us at <a href="mailto:support@battle-squire.com">support@battle-squire.com</a>.</p>
