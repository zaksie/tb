    <h2>The Crypting Challenge</h2>
    <p>In TotalBattle, every player’s got a job to do: explore crypts and battle citadels to snag valuable chests for the clan. These chests aren’t just loot—they’re a measure of your worth. Clans keep a sharp eye on chest output to spot the slackers and celebrate the champs. But let’s face it—manually exploring crypts is a grind, eating up hours of tedious clicking.</p>
