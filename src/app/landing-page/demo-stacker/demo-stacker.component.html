    <h2>Squads Rule the Fight</h2>
    <p>In TotalBattle, combat is a strategic showdown where preparation meets opportunity. You and your enemy assemble armies from different troop types—each with unique strengths, like brutal attackers, sturdy defenders, or crafty specialists. Once the battle kicks off, an algorithm locks in the order your squads will strike, and the real test begins.</p>

    <h2>How It Works</h2>
    <p>Every cycle, each squad gets exactly one chance to hit. The order is set, the first strike is a 50-50 coin toss, and then it’s a relentless back-and-forth. The twist? The side with more squads lands more blows per cycle. Bring five squads against your enemy’s three, and you’re hitting twice more every round. It’s a numbers game with a tactical edge—more squads don’t just mean more power, they mean more opportunities to wear down your foe.</p>
